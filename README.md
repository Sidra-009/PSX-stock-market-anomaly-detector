## 🤖 How the AI Works

### 📡 Data
The app first tries to fetch **live quotes** from PSX's official API. If unavailable, it generates **realistic synthetic data** using price simulation — so it always works even offline.

### 🔍 Anomaly Detection (3 methods)
| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🌲 Isolation Forest | ML model that finds unusual trading days |
| 📐 Z-Score | Flags returns or volume more than 3× normal |
| 🚨 Pump & Dump | Detects sudden price surge + high volume together |

### 🔮 7-Day Forecast
Uses **Linear Regression** on 7 technical indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands, volume ratio, moving averages) to predict the next week's price movement.

### 🚦 Alert Levels
| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🔴 High | Something very unusual happened — check immediately |
| 🟡 Medium | Something a bit unusual — keep an eye on it |
| 🟢 Low | Minor irregularity — just for your information |

## 📊 Features Explained Simply

**RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
- Below 30 = Stock fell too much (❄️ Too Cold) — might go up soon
- Above 70 = Stock rose too much (🔥 Too Hot) — might fall soon
- 30–70 = Normal (✅)

**Volume Ratio**
- How much more trading happened today vs the average
- 2.5× or more = Unusual — something big might be happening

**Pump & Dump**
- When someone buys a lot to push the price up (Pump 🔺) then sells everything (Dump 🔻)
- Our AI detects this pattern automatically
